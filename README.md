# What is Draco?

Mostly an excuse to play with Nu, Draco is a shameless clone of Marc Hedlund's excellent [Dragon's Breath] [1].

# Usage

In order to build Draco you will need to install [Nu] [2] and [ZeroKit] [3]. The default Nu installation should suffice, but be sure to install ZeroKit to:

    /Library/Frameworks/

Building and running Draco is really easy, just invoke the following at the command line:

    $ nuke run

If Nu is installed properly Draco should now be running.
