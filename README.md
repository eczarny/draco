# What is Draco?

Mostly  an  excuse to play with Nu, Draco is a shameless clone of Marc Hedlund's
excellent [Dragon's Breath] [1].

# Usage

Building  and  running  Draco  is  really easy, just invoke the following at the
command line:

    $ nuke run

If Nu is installed properly Draco should now be running.
